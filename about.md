## Hobby
I started `running` as a hobby when I came to Malaysia back in 2014 and since then running has become a part of my life and have completed the half marathon twice. If you are interested to take up running as your new hobby start with the **most easiest part in running** i.e. registering online for a marathon.

I used to take the bicycle (*or just cycle as we call it*) everyday to school back in India, and that helped me to be a `cycling` junkie here in Kuala Lumpur. The longest cycling route done by me is the [LEKAS](http://www.lekashighwayride.my/){:target="_blank"} highway ride *105 km* back in 2017.


Became a certified [`PADI scuba diver`](https://www.padi.com/courses/open-water-diver){:target="_blank"} in 2016 and have logged 20 dives till date, all in the beautiful waters of Malaysia.  After 20 dives,  had to call it a day as my sinuses weren't helping me with my diving(*My nose was bleeding everytime I came out of the water*).

In 2017 I hiked Mt. Rinjani, one of the highest active volcanoes in Indonesia(*don't start your research about the height now*) which till date is one of the best memory I ever had. `Hiking` is the only sport that came natural for me compared to the others.

I enjoy history, politics, and have a particular interest in studying charachteristics of social groups(Anthropology). Standup Comedy is my boredom killer.
