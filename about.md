## Projects

[ To be updated ]

## Hobby
I started `running` when I landed in Malaysia in 2014 and since then running became a part of my life. I've done many 10 km runs and a couple of times the half marathon.

`Question:  What is the easiest part in doing a marathon???  The online registration.`


I got into `cycling` in 2015 and have my customized road bike and completed a few cyclathon's with the longest being the 105km [LEKAS](http://www.lekashighwayride.my/){:target="_blank"} night ride in 2017.


I'm a certified [`PADI open water diver`](https://www.padi.com/courses/open-water-diver){:target="_blank"}  and have done 20 dives, all in the beautiful underwaters of Malaysia. But after 20 dives I had to call it  a day as my sinuses weren't helping me with my diving as the blood in my nose after every dive started freaking me out .

I used to travel often in the [SEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia){:target="_blank"}  region to explore this land. In 2017 I completed the Rinjani Summit, one of the highest active volcanoes in Indonesia(*don't start your research about the height now*) which till date is one of the best memory I have in life. `Hiking` is the only thing that came natural to me compared to all the other sports I do.

I enjoy history, politics *(influenced by GOT)* and have a particular interest in Anthropology.  Btw, if you haven't watched [`Fight Club`](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523){:target="_blank"}, go watch now.
