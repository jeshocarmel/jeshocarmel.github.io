Continuing from my previous [post](https://jeshocarmel.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/06/02/review_of_books.html) here is a review of 5 other books I read during the covid19 lockdown. 


#### **[1.  7 Breakthrough Habits ](https://7breakthroughhabits.com/){:target="_blank"}** 


*Author: Nelson Tjiunardi*

![deep work](/assets/images/7breakthrough.png){:height="30%" width="25%"}
  
  - A book written by a businessman / ambassador of God in earth who is also my mentor. It's his first book.
  - The book draws out a plan for a nominal christian to cultivate habits and grow into an effective one. 
  - The topic of eternity is discussed extensively with simple examples which helped me visualize how it's all going to turn out in the end.
  - I incorporated a few habits from this book.
  - The book could've been trimmed.

#### [**2. Judith: Martyred Missionary of Russia**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6093497-judith-martyred-missionary-of-russia){:target="_blank"}

*Author: N. I. Saloff-Astakhoff*

![hygge](/assets/images/judith.jpg ){:height="30%" width="25%"}

- A very old book (1941). 
- A biography of a young jewish girl who lived in Russia during the world war I. Biographies about missionary workers always amaze me. 
- The book details the life endured by a girl who was made an apostate and sent to the wilderness by her parents, siblings, community and lover because she chose Christ.
- The books ends with a spine chilling chapter on how the missionary was murdered on a cold day in Russia during the Bolshevik Revolution.
- It's read that I couldn't get off my chest for a while.

#### [**3. The Alchemist** ](https://www.amazon.in/Alchemist-Paulo-Coelho-ebook/dp/B00U6SFUSS){:target="_blank"}

*Author: Paulo Coelho*

![problem of pain](/assets/images/alchemist.jpg ){:height="30%" width="25%"}


- A book everyone should read at least one in their lifetime.
- A life philosophy written with at most simplicity. 
- The author does the perfect recipe with life ingredients such as love, gold, dreams, nature, religion , soul and made the best dish ever.
- I don't have words that can help write a review for this masterpiece. Read it for yourself and tell me. 
- Unputdownable

#### [**4. Pride & Prejudice**](https://www.amazon.in/Pride-Prejudice-Jane-Austen-ebook/dp/B076X7QJFS/){:target="_blank"}

*Author: Jane Austen*

![clean coder](/assets/images/prideandprejudice.jpg ){:height="30%" width="25%"}


- Jane Austen first took me to 19th century high society England and then narrated me tale about two individuals who overcame their pride and prejudice to fall in love.
- The characters are well written. The author writes unspoken words in a relationship with elegance and ease.
- A romance penned to perfection. I can say with confidence that no other novel could potray romance better than this.
