Continuing from my previous [post](https://jeshocarmel.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/07/12/review_of_books_2.html), I am writing my review of 5 more books which I've dusted this year.


#### **[1.  The Adventures of Tom Sawyer ](https://www.amazon.in/Adventures-Tom-Sawyer-AmazonClassics-ebook/dp/B072F1WKW1){:target="_blank"}** 


*Author: Mark Twain*

![Tom Sawyer](/assets/images/tomsawyer.jpg){:height="30%" width="25%"}
  
- The classic american novel everyone knows.
- It's a good comedy I would say. Tom Sawyer reminded me during my early days.
- Various american accents put in words were a bit difficult to read at first but gets easier after a while.
- If you are looking for a story about childish adventures or you wanted to be reminded about your own childhood I would recommend this read.

#### [**2. All of Grace**](https://www.amazon.in/All-Grace-Charles-Spurgeon-ebook/dp/B075QNR7WM){:target="_blank"}

*Author: Charles Spurgeon*

![All of Grace](/assets/images/allofgrace.jpg ){:height="30%" width="25%"}

- An unexpected surprise. Glanced the first page and ended up finishing the book in a week. 
- The author speaks straight from his heart without holding back any words which can maneuver the reader exactly to where he wants to go.
- The book gives a complete insight on two subjects- faith & grace which I feel is often not put clearly in the church.
- A book I recommend every christian to grab and read. 
- If you are a non-christian and you would like to know about faith or have wondered what is grace, this is where you would find the answer. You won't be disappointed. I can promise you that.

#### [**3. Nikola Tesla: Imagination and the Man That Invented the 20th Century**](https://www.amazon.in/Nikola-Tesla-Imagination-Invented-Century-ebook/dp/B086SGPQNN/){:target="_blank"}

*Author: Sean Patrick*

![Nikolas Tesla](/assets/images/tesla.jpg ){:height="30%" width="25%"}

- My second book from the same author.
- A short account of the man who invented Alternating Current and changed our way of life forever.
- The author writes about the feud between Edison and Tesla which I never knew. 
- As usual, the author finishes up with take-away lessons from Tesla's life which is his never give up attitude.

#### [**4. Animal Farm**](https://www.amazon.com/Animal-Farm-George-Orwell-ebook/dp/B008DM43QY){:target="_blank"}

*Author: George Orwell a.k.a Eric Arthur Blair*

![Animal Farm](/assets/images/animalsfarm.jpg ){:height="30%" width="25%"}

- Critically acclaimed book. A short one too.
- The book takes a dig the underlying principles of communism.
- The author speaks his mind through a group of farm animals who have got rid of their master, a Mr. Jones and have started running their own farm under the leadership of a pig named Napolean.
- It's super hilarious

#### [**5. The Old Man and the Sea** ](https://www.amazon.com/Old-Man-Sea-Ernest-Hemingway-ebook/dp/B000FC0SH8){:target="_blank"}

*Author:  Ernest Hemingway*

![The old man and the sea](/assets/images/oldmansea.jpg ){:height="30%" width="25%"}

- Another critically acclaimed book. The book was awarded a Pulitzer back in 1953.
- A novella about a old man who has run into a bad luck streak of 84 days without catching a fish.
- He encounters a huge marlin on the 85th day but will get back home with it ?
- My expectations were set very high by the name 'Hemingway' and hence I found it to be 'okay'. Maybe I should have expected nothing and would've found this interesting.
- However I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. One man's trash is another man's treasure.
