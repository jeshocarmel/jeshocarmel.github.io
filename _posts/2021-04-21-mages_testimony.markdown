###  Context

If you would have read my previous [post](https://jeshocarmel.github.io/jekyll/update/2021/04/20/testimony.html){:target="_blank"}, you will know how God faithfully bought us across continents admidst a world-wide lockdown. In this post, I write the testimony of how God blessed my wife with a job she never expected.

My wife was a credit risk analyst with Maybank back in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. That was her first professional job and she held on to it for very long 8 years. She never really wanted another job or to move out of Malaysia. On the other hand, I always had wanted to exit Malaysia and she knew my desires from day 1. I was desperately looking at every opportunity to get out of Malaysia while she was carrying on with her job. The job at Maybank was a safe place to her. It was an easy commute. She knew everyone there. It's a well known bank in Malaysia and when you work there, many people look in awe *(we all love that don't we?)*.

### Lockdown 2020

When I was attending interviews in the lockdown, things were changing at her workplace. She joined a new team in 2019 and when lockdown happened, the work added up. As the economy tanked all over the world, financial institutions were badly affected. She had to work long hours during the initial days of lock-down and the working hours kept increasing. There were adhoc requests to submit financial reports within short duration and she will stretch to 14 hours a day and occasionally pull an all-nighter. 

WhatsApp would beep at 4 am, 5 am, 6 am in the morning. As a couple, it was affecting my sleep as well while I was preparing for interviews. I would wake up at 7 in the morning to prepare for my interviews and she wouldn't have slept the whole night, working at her desk, cleaning up the reports before sending it to the bosses. Two times she went a full 48 hours without sleep. At one point, I told her to quit and be stress free as we weren't in need of much money but she wouldn't. (If you're thinking to sue me for being politically incorrect or whatever the the 2021 norms are, for asking my wife to resign, you can contact my [lawyer](https://pics.me.me/uma-lawyer-your-argument-is-invalid-ne-im-a-lawyer-53391166.png){:target="_blank"}).

Fast forward, in Jan 2021, the LORD blessed me with my dream job in Amazon. I still hadn't discussed on plans to move to Germany but I didn't want to be the husband who asked his wife to quit her job (again) to purse my plans and dreams. When the offer came in from Amazon Germany, she was looking at possible options to transfer to Maybank London or take a long sabbatical (2 years). Like I mentioned earlier, Maybank was her comfort zone. She was still finding ways to keep her job and work around that. I was mum and also didn't really keep it much in prayer. I had a faith that if God has given a job, he pretty much will solve the rest of the equation. To get the job was the difficult part for me honestly and I have written more about it in my earlier post.

While we were still contemplating what to do, her annual review was coming in February. 
Considering the effort that she put in last year to clear up everything in time, it was a no-brainer it would be a good feedback with a decent bonus. But....she got an average review with the least bonus she ever received in her career. The reason given was that the economy is not good due to covid which in turn means the bank is not good which in turn means less bonus for you. But we sneaky humans know how to sniff how much bonus everyone has received, don't we. Turns out there were no deductions because of Covid for the others and some in her team had even obtained 3x the bonus she received along with awards. My wife was devastated. What happens next? Disappointment. A feeling of being deceived followed by some tears. (I've been in that situation very early in my career).


###  What I think happened...

I was coming from a different perspective to this whole situation (of course, every outsider has a perspective to someone's problem. Don't they ?). I believed,  what  happened in the past year was, she was so focussed on her job and getting things done and satisfying her manager demands and making sure her work is clean while losing prayer time. She used to spend 1 hour reading the Bible and pray but these were reduced to a mere ~5 mins prayer + Bible reading before sleep. Satan does know how to keep us occupied, doesn't he ?

After much disappointment, tears and all night praying, she handed in her resignation informing the bank that she wasn't recognized for her efforts. I asked her what made her resign and she said God spoke to her to let go of that job. (Women listen to God better than to men don't they :D)

And then blah blah, you should have guessed the flight took off and we landed in Berlin. 

###  The job hunt begins


My wife had to do a job hunt now. She hadn't attended an interview in 8 years. She had no resume and didn't have a linkedIN account. I prepared a rough resume having good experience in preparing software engineer resume and imported a bankers resume into an IT one. It didn't look that good. I have to be honest here :D

We sent out the resume to a 100 companies and heard nothing back. We learnt through some friends that the job market here works differently. Your resume and presentation skills on your resume are considered very important. German CVs usually include a photograph and a  clear task split and gives a clear understanding of who your are in a single preview. And boy-o-boy, knowing german is an unspoken must for bankers. No wonder, we didn't had any callbacks. 

Modified the resume and sent it again and we wait for some reply. Nothing much happened, a few replies came but they didn't want to proceed with a phone screen.

2 months passed, Deutsche bank called her for a phone screen. It was a job I applied on behalf of my wife with the old resume months back. For those who don't know Deutsche bank, it is a german bank which happens to be one of the two german banks that have english services for customers. But we knew that they will expect german skills at-least speaking skills as most of the work-force are German in the German offices.

The phone screen happened and to her surprise, the interviewer informed that German language is not necessary for this role. Our [church](https://www.odmchurch.de/){:target="_blank"} in Berlin was praying alongside us. The next round came and then another two rounds and she got the job. It was really unexpected as this was the first interview she did in Germany and God blessed her with something she never expected. The added bonus was that it was a senior role, a promotion to her role back in Malaysia.

###  Summary

We are still in awe of what happened but I my hypothesis is like this (I might be totally wrong about this) - God wanted to teach my wife a lesson that no job is a safe place.  Yet an other perspective - God didn't like reduced prayer time from her. We will never know for sure it was either one of the above or something totally different but I will ask when I meet him.

We just knew one thing - God planned things way ahead of our move, and on his command everything fell into place at the right place at the appointed time.

I believe we have to accept a fact that no job is a safe place. There's no comfort zone in earth. At the least for a christian, there's no safe place in earth. Everyday is a battle and in every minute a trap is laid for you. One other lesson we learnt was - When God says "let go of something", it's better to let go whatever it is and blindly follow his advice. He will sort it out. He even sorted Adam's mistake by sending his son to earth thereby settling the score with Satan, didn't he?

I will leave you, the reader with a verse from the [Bible](https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/New-International-Version-NIV-Bible/){:target="_blank"}.

> God is our safe place and our strength. He is always our help when we are in trouble. So we will not be afraid, even if the earth is shaken and the mountains fall into the center of the sea, and even if its waters go wild with storm and the mountains shake with its action. - The Psalmist 46: 1-3


<small>PS: Also, while reading this post, if you think that I'm accusing/complaing about Maybank's work ethics, you're missing the point. This is a post on God's work not about a corporate place. I wanted to give in the real details with real facts rather than imaginary names. Also, I worked in Maybank for 3.5 years, it's a great workplace and I had a wonderful time there.</small>
